## Which Agent Should I Use?

Not sure where to start? Use this quick reference. Skills are the canonical workflow surface; maintained slash entries stay available for command-first workflows.

| I want to... | Use this surface | Agent used |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Plan a new feature | `/ecc:plan "Add auth"` | planner |
| Design system architecture | `/ecc:plan` + architect agent | architect |
| Write code with tests first | `tdd-workflow` skill | tdd-guide |
| Review code I just wrote | `/code-review` | code-reviewer |
| Fix a failing build | `/build-fix` | build-error-resolver |
| Run end-to-end tests | `e2e-testing` skill | e2e-runner |
| Find security vulnerabilities | `/security-scan` | security-reviewer |
| Remove dead code | `/refactor-clean` | refactor-cleaner |
| Update documentation | `/update-docs` | doc-updater |
| Review Go code | `/go-review` | go-reviewer |
| Review Python code | `/python-review` | python-reviewer |
| Review F# code | *(invoke `fsharp-reviewer` directly)* | fsharp-reviewer |
| Review TypeScript/JavaScript code | *(invoke `typescript-reviewer` directly)* | typescript-reviewer |
| Develop HarmonyOS apps | *(invoke `harmonyos-app-resolver` directly)* | harmonyos-app-resolver |
| Audit database queries | *(auto-delegated)* | database-reviewer |
| Review production ML changes | `mle-workflow` skill + `mle-reviewer` agent | mle-reviewer |

### Common Workflows

Slash forms below are shown where they remain part of the maintained command surface. Retired short-name shims such as `/tdd` and `/eval` live in `legacy-command-shims/` for explicit opt-in only.

**Starting a new feature:**
```
/ecc:plan "Add user authentication with OAuth"
                                              → planner creates implementation blueprint
tdd-workflow skill                            → tdd-guide enforces write-tests-first
/code-review                                  → code-reviewer checks your work
```

**Fixing a bug:**
```
tdd-workflow skill                            → tdd-guide: write a failing test that reproduces it
                                              → implement the fix, verify test passes
/code-review                                  → code-reviewer: catch regressions
```

**Preparing for production:**
```
/security-scan                                → security-reviewer: OWASP Top 10 audit
e2e-testing skill                             → e2e-runner: critical user flow tests
/test-coverage                                → verify 80%+ coverage
```
